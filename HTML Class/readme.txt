Project Description:
This project consists of a simple HTML webpage styled with CSS. The webpage includes a header, two sections for content, a link to a secret page, and a footer. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate basic HTML and CSS skills with enhanced visual appeal, including a clickable link to a secret page with a fun fact about the author.

HTML and CSS Files:
- index.html: This is the main HTML file for the webpage. It includes the structure and content of the homepage, such as the header, introduction section, content section, and a footer. It also contains a link to the secret page.
- secret.html: This is the secondary HTML file for the secret page. It includes a fun fact about the author, structured similarly to the main page with a header, main content section, and footer.
- styles.css: This is the CSS file that styles both the main and secret HTML pages. It includes styles for the body, header, main sections, links, and footer to ensure a consistent look and feel across both pages.
